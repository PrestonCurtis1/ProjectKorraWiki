AIRSWIPE
############

Description
###########

**Element:** Air

AirSwipe creates a fast-moving, crescent-shaped blade of air that travels forward, damaging and knocking back enemies in its path. It can also extinguish flames and break certain projectiles, making it both offensive and utility-based.

Usage
#####

**Function 1:** Left-click to launch a swipe of air in the direction you're facing

**Function 2:** Hold sneak and then left-click for a wider arc (if configured)

.. tip:: AirSwipe is a great all-around move â€” use it for offense, defense, and utility. Try using it to cancel incoming fire blasts or hit multiple enemies at once!
