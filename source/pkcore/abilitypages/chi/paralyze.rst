Description
###########

**Element:** Chi

Paralyze is a chi-blocking ability that allows the user to temporarily freeze an opponentâ€™s body, restricting their movements and preventing them from using their bending abilities. The user targets a specific enemy, channeling chi into them to disrupt their flow of energy and induce a state of immobility.

Usage
#####

**Function 1:** Sneak to charge the ability and lock onto an enemy  
**Function 2:** Left-click to release the paralyzing chi, freezing the enemy in place  
**Function 3:** The target remains paralyzed for a short duration, unable to move or use bending abilities

.. tip:: Use Paralyze to disable powerful opponents or stop enemies from escaping. Timing is key to preventing a counterattack!
