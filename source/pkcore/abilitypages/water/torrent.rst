TORRENT
############

Description
###########

**Element:** Water

Torrent is a powerful waterbending ability that allows the user to gather and manipulate a large stream of water, which can be launched at enemies with immense force. The ability is highly versatileâ€”capable of being used defensively to block attacks, or offensively to knock back and damage opponents. It requires a water source to initiate.

Usage
#####

**Function 1:** Hold sneak to gather water from a source into a swirling stream around the user

**Function 2:** Release sneak to launch the torrent forward, dealing damage and knocking back any targets in its path

**Function 3:** Aim the torrent to wrap around the user as a water shield before launching it in any direction

.. tip:: Practice timing your sneak and release to maximize control of the torrent. Great for crowd control and turning defense into offense.
